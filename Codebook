## This Codebook describes the columns in the tidy data set 
## I described the transformations I used to get to the tidy data set in the ReadME.md file in this repo
 
## The first column of the tidy data set is the indexx for the individual taking part in the experiment
## There are 30 individuals in the study, each one indexed by a number from 1 to 30

## The second column of the tidy data set is the activity
## There are six possible activities: "walking", "walking upstairs", "walking downstairs", "sitting", "standing", "laying"

## This tidy data set relates to a broader data set of observed values from a study of human activity using smartphones
## The broader data set had 561 variables

## The 561 variables related to observations from the accelerometer and from the gyroscope
## In the first instance, time domain signals were captured, filtered, and separated into body and gravity signals

## Subsequently, the body acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals
## The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals was calculated

## Finally, a FastFourier Transform was applied to some of these signals

## From the broader data set, I focused on a subset of 66 variables in the "selected data set"
## These 66 variables included the means and standard deviations of the various observations described above

## In the final calculation of the tidy data set, I calculated the means of each of the 66 variables in the "selected data set"
 
## Note that all of the data sets in the broader data set were normalized to be within the range [-1,1]
